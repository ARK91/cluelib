###How to install
####Using Git
1. `git clone https://github.com/cluelogic/cluelib`
1. Go to the **run** directory: `cd cluelib/run`
1. Check makefile options: `make help`
1. Run a satity check. Use one of the simulators listed in the previous step: 
   Do `make vcs` for example.
1. If you see no errors, the library is in good shape. See the list of
   compatible simulators below.

####In a traditional way
1. Click the **Download ZIP** button on the right.
1. Unzip the source code: `unzip cluelib-master.zip`
1. Go to the **run** directory: `cd cluelib-master/run`
1. Check makefile options: `make help`
1. Run a satity check. Use one of the simulators listed in the previous step: 
   Do `make vcs` for example.
1. If you see no errors, the library is in good shape. See the list of
   compatible simulators below.

####Compatible simulators
The library has been tested on the following simulators:
- *Incisive Enterprise Simulator* (Version 12.20-s031) of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
- *Questa Advanced Simulator* (Version 10.2c) of Mentor Graphics Corporation
- *VCS* (Version G-2012.09-SP1) of Synopsys, Inc.

###How to use
Compile `src/cl_pkg.sv` (and optional `src/cl_dpi.cc`) with your files.
- The `src/cl_pkg.sv` includes all library files.  Make sure your `+incdir`
  option points to the **src** directory when you compile.
- By default, DPI-C is disabled. If you want to use the DPI-C, uncomment the
  **CL_USE_DPI_C** macro in `src/cl_define.svh` and compile the `src/cl_dpi.cc`
  with the `src/cl_pkg.sv`.
- Sample makefiles are available under the **run** directory.

###Pull requests policy
Unlike other open-source projects, in which contributors use their own time and
software, the verification libraries are usually developed using their
employerâ€™s resources. Typically, the copyright of such libraries belong to
their employer. **To avoid potential risks with lawsuits, we have decided not to
accept any _Pull Requests_ from individual contributors.** This may not be the
ideal eco-system, but the users can still make comments on the library and fork
the library to extend it by themselves.  Although we will not accept the source
code in itself, we will accept a request for developing a new class or a
function. Because the new function might immediately benefit other users, we
will try to add it on a regular basis to make the library more useful.
